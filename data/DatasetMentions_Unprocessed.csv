two chest x-ray datasets: mimic-cxr (johnson

additional radiologist-labelled dataset in this paper.
we recruit a board-certified radiologist co-author to
manually label 1,200 reports in mimic-cxr which
have been labelled as no finding by the chexpert labeller, an automatic rule-based nlp model

this dataset is available on the physionet repository

recent advances
in technology and regulations
around them have enabled the collection of an unprecedented amount of data of past decisions and
outcomes in different domains such as health care,
recommendation systems, and education. this offers a unique opportunity to learn better decisionmaking policies using observational data. off-policy
policy evaluation (ope) is concerned with estimating the value of a proposed policy (evaluation policy) using the data collected under a different policy
(behaviour policy).estimating the value of an evaluation policy before deployment is essential, especially
when interacting with the environment is expensive,
risky, or unethical, such as in health care (gottesman
et al., 2019). fortunately, the reinforcement learning (rl) community has developed different methods and theories focused on ope, e.g. jiang and li
(2016); thomas and brunskill (2016); kallus and uehara (2020).
ope has been used extensively in the literature
to demonstrate the superiority of a proposed evaluation policy relative to the baseline (behaviour) policy
e.g. komorowski et al. (2018); however, the evaluation policy may be better than the behaviour policy for some individuals but not others. hence, only
looking at the estimated value of the evaluation policy before deployment, may be misleading.
in the
non-sequential setting, a growing literature has focused on personalization and estimation of heterogeneous treatment effect (hte), the individual-level
