#### Who did you help this week?

It's not much but Amelia & Olivia seem to be interested in the (creative, critical & feminism) methods of ETHOS lab, which I told them I joined recently.

#### What helped you this week?

* The [pdfminer.six](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six) project gave me a decent way to bulk-extract text from PDFs.
* Thu Vu's https://github.com/thu-vu92/the_witcher_network project was some nice inspo.

#### What did you achieve?

* Devised basic pipeline for data collection.
  * Still need to finish the code, though :)

#### What did you struggle with?

* Text extraction from PDFs
  * My previous tool, https://github.com/kingaling/pydf2json was outdated and too verbose.
  * Recovered thanks to pdfminer.six.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Replace this text with a bullet point list of what you would like to work on next week.
* It's ok if your list is only one bullet point long!
* Try to estimate how long each task will take.

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

* Nothing for this week :)

#### Any other topics

Maybe should meet with Bethany some time next week to exchange ideas.

#### What helped you this week?

Some resources on semantic search for flexible keyword queries:
* Hugging Face: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OATCgQtNX2o
* Amir Shamsi on Gensim: https://stackoverflow.com/a/71828372/2089784
* Trey Grainger on Data Philosophy and Solr: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fMZnunTRF8

#### What did you achieve?

* [Collected MIDl 2018 papers](https://github.com/madprogramer/PublicDatasets/blob/main/data/ResearchPapers.csv)
  * Annotated for DOI, if available
  * Annotated for keywrod matches

#### What did you struggle with?

* Did not find any matches for `Data Science Bowl 2017`.
* Precise keyword searches can miss, false negative matches

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Figure out PDF extraction pipeline. Searching for datasets in conference papers is like searching for a needle in a haystack so we need to be able to process more PDFs faster.

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

* Is it a good idea to stick to MIDL (future years?)
  * MICCAI?
* Try different keywords maybe
